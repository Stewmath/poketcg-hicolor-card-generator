Feel free to use this code any way you feel fit.

You can use this code / algorithm in any commercial product. It would be great

And now for the usual bull..

This software is supplied on an as-is basis, although I don't believe that
there are any bugs in my code, I will not be held responsible for any damage
this program may cause....
